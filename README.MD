Have you ever discovered a modpack, seen the twenty-page list of mods, and decided to play without knowing exactly what mods are you using? This mod is the solution to all your nightmares: it replaces the splash screen random texts with a message that announces one of the mods that you're using. The message is randomized, and thus helps you slowly discover the mods that you are playing with.

# ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
There are a couple of options you can play with in `.minecraft/config/vanity_splash_text/config.toml`

- **`skip_seasonal_splash_text`:** By default the mod doesn't override seasonal splash texts (Christmas, New year and Halloween). Set this option to true to always show the vanity messages.
  - Valid values: true / false
- **`ignore_modid_regex`:** Some mods are excluded from the generated list of messages, using the regex set in this field. Feel free to modify it to better suit your modpack. The default will ignore java, minecraft, quilt and API mods.
  - Valid values: regex expressions that exclude a mod if they **exactly** match its mod id

# üìö Modpacks
This mod has been designed with modpacks in mind, so i'll be very glad if you include it in yours. (Using this mod is also a great way to credit the mods in your modpack)
